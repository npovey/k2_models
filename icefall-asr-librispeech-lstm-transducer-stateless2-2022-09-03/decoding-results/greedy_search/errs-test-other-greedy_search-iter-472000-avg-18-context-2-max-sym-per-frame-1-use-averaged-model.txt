3538-142836-0001-196-0:	THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT (THE->A) SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE (QUANTITIES->QUALITIES) THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002-197-0:	FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003-198-0:	BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004-199-0:	IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE (SYRUP->SERP) AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005-200-0:	LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006-201-0:	IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007-202-0:	BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE (HAS->IS) NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008-203-0:	FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-142836-0009-204-0:	BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010-205-0:	THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011-206-0:	FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP (WILL->WOULD) BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012-207-0:	THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY (ARE TURNED->RETURNED)
3538-142836-0013-208-0:	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014-209-0:	MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT (PASTES ARE OF->PASTE SERVE) THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL (REQUEST->QUEST)
3538-142836-0015-210-0:	(MARMALADES->MARMAL EATS) AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF (A->*) HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016-211-0:	THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT (IS->AS) NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017-212-0:	IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A (TRIVET->TRIMET) UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018-213-0:	(CONFECTIONARY->CONFECTIONERY) FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019-214-0:	IN SPEAKING OF (CONFECTIONARY IT->CONFECTIONERY) SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS (ROOTS AND JUICES->REJUICES) WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD (CONFICERE->CONFIRSE) TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM (CONFECTIONARY->CONFECTIONERY) EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE
3538-142836-0020-215-0:	(THE->A) THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021-216-0:	HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE (REIGNS->REIGN) OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022-217-0:	THE SHAPE OF THE (DISHES->DISH IS) VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023-218-0:	(ICES->ICE)
3538-142836-0024-219-0:	(AT->I) DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025-220-0:	THE (SPADDLE->SPATTLE) IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026-221-0:	THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING (*->OF) THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000-247-0:	THERE WAS ONCE ON (A->THE) TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001-248-0:	FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002-249-0:	BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003-250-0:	KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004-251-0:	WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005-252-0:	(THE YOUTH->THESE) PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006-253-0:	AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007-254-0:	WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008-255-0:	WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009-256-0:	ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010-257-0:	SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011-258-0:	OUT ON (THEE->THE) UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT

4294-35475-0007-120-0:	THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST (REND->RUN) ME IN (PIECES->PEACES) THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008-121-0:	IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009-122-0:	AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010-123-0:	SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM (THE OGRE'S->YOGRE'S) MIGHT
4294-35475-0011-124-0:	HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A (MILLSTON->MILLSTONE)
4294-35475-0012-125-0:	THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013-126-0:	THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014-127-0:	HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE (WEB->WEAP) AND GAVE THE (FLY ITS->FLIGHTS) FREEDOM
4294-35475-0015-128-0:	A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE
4294-35475-0016-129-0:	THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017-130-0:	AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018-131-0:	IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019-132-0:	WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED (ON->DOWN) HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020-133-0:	WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021-134-0:	(MY->BY) GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM (OVERRIPENESS->OVER RIPENESS) BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022-135-0:	THE (GRANDAME->GRAND DAME) WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S (COUNCILLOR->COUNSELLOR) TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND (TO->*) BEGGAR (OR->*) LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023-136-0:	TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME (KNIGHTS->NIGHTS) AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024-137-0:	AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE (ETHELRIED'S->ETHELRED') BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025-138-0:	BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026-139-0:	SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE (PRINCE CISEAUX->PRINCESO)
4294-9934-0000-140-0:	HE FELT (WHAT->WITH) THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM (AND->*) THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY (ARRIVE->ARRIVED) LATER
4294-9934-0001-141-0:	HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT (ALREADY->ALREAD)
4294-9934-0002-142-0:	HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003-143-0:	TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004-144-0:	MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005-145-0:	THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006-146-0:	WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007-147-0:	HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008-148-0:	HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009-149-0:	IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010-150-0:	THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011-151-0:	REQUEST (COURFEYRAC->KERFYRAC) TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012-152-0:	WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID (COURFEYRAC->CURFAC)
4294-9934-0013-153-0:	WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014-154-0:	SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015-155-0:	YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016-156-0:	THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017-157-0:	NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018-158-0:	DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019-159-0:	IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020-160-0:	THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021-161-0:	HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE (WATCHMAKER'S->WATCHMAKERS)
4294-9934-0022-162-0:	HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023-163-0:	HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024-164-0:	THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025-165-0:	I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026-166-0:	THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027-167-0:	ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY (PISTOLES->PISTOL) THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD (IN->AND) A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028-168-0:	MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH (A->*) RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029-169-0:	AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000-423-0:	HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001-424-0:	BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002-425-0:	THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST (KITTY->KATY)
4350-10919-0003-426-0:	WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004-427-0:	IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005-428-0:	AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006-429-0:	THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007-430-0:	AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS (MALNUTRITION->MALUTRITION) NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008-431-0:	THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009-432-0:	YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010-433-0:	BEG PARDON IS THE (YAUSKY BRIDGE->YS KEEPER IT) DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
4350-10919-0011-434-0:	HE ASKED AH IT IS
4350-10919-0012-435-0:	(OH WELL->WHO WILL) THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013-436-0:	AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014-437-0:	WHAT IS WANTED IS (*->THE) MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015-438-0:	THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016-439-0:	BUT IN (FAVOR->FAVOUR) OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017-440-0:	AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018-441-0:	AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019-442-0:	(OH->O) TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020-443-0:	THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED (TO->THAT) THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021-444-0:	OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022-445-0:	AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023-446-0:	WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024-447-0:	SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025-448-0:	EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026-449-0:	THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027-450-0:	THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE (OFFENSE->OFFENCE)
4350-10919-0028-451-0:	NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS (WHEN KITTY->GWINKITTI) HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029-452-0:	AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030-453-0:	(AT->BUT) THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031-454-0:	FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032-455-0:	IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033-456-0:	THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000-362-0:	EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001-363-0:	(THIS IS->MISSUS) ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002-364-0:	IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003-365-0:	THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004-366-0:	THE MAN WHO (IS->WAS) CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005-367-0:	THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006-368-0:	THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON (IN->AND) SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007-369-0:	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT (CONSTITUTE->CONSTITUTES) THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008-370-0:	THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009-371-0:	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010-372-0:	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011-373-0:	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012-374-0:	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013-375-0:	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW (STANDARD->STANDARDS) OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF (*->THE) GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014-376-0:	BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE (STRIFE->STRIPE) BETWEEN (INDIVIDUALS SEEMS->THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED) STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015-377-0:	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016-378-0:	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017-379-0:	BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018-380-0:	INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019-381-0:	GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020-382-0:	AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021-383-0:	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT (TIMES->TIME) SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022-384-0:	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023-385-0:	(FOOTNOTE->FOOTNOTES) THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY (FAILS->FAIL) TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024-386-0:	THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025-387-0:	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE (FRONTIERS->FRONTIER) ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE (CENTER->CENTRE) ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026-388-0:	THE MEANING OF (CAPRIVI'S->CAPRIVI) SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027-389-0:	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028-390-0:	BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND (*->ARE) ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029-391-0:	AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030-392-0:	THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT (ONE->A) HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031-393-0:	EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032-394-0:	THE DESPOTISM OF (A->THE) GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033-395-0:	THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES (IN->AND) CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034-396-0:	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES (PRACTICED->PRACTISED) UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN (OPPRESSORS->IMPRESSORS)
4350-9170-0035-397-0:	THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS (IN->AND) UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036-398-0:	IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037-399-0:	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038-400-0:	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY (EXPOSE->EXPOSED) THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039-401-0:	THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040-402-0:	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041-403-0:	BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042-404-0:	GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL (DEFENSE->DEFENCE) BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043-405-0:	(THEY ARE->THERE) NEEDED (PRINCIPALLY->PRINCIPLE THEY) AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044-406-0:	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045-407-0:	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF (THE->A) STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046-408-0:	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047-409-0:	WE (KNOW->*) NOW (*->KNOW) THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048-410-0:	SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0049-411-0:	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050-412-0:	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING (ANY THING->ANYTHING)
4350-9170-0051-413-0:	THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052-414-0:	THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053-415-0:	WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054-416-0:	THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM (NEIGHBORING->NEIGHBOURING) STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055-417-0:	AND IF (DEFENSE->DEFENCE) AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056-418-0:	THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057-419-0:	EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH (*->THE) STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058-420-0:	TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059-421-0:	SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF (THE->A) WEALTHY (CLASSES->CLASS) AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060-422-0:	FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000-0-0:	SAY YOU KNOW (SUMTHIN->SOMETHING)
4852-28311-0001-1-0:	CHRIS LOOKED FROM A (NICKEL PLATED->NICK COMPLATED) FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG

6128-63241-0001-1920-0:	THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT (CLIME->CLIMB) AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002-1921-0:	RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL

6128-63241-0009-1928-0:	(OLIVE->OLIV) HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010-1929-0:	SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011-1930-0:	SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
